# maptomic
A free tool for generating maps (normal maps,dudv maps,height maps etc) on linux

Height maps generation is done,although it needs some customizable parameters...will be added later since it's low priority. 

Normal map generation is done. It does not compute values on the border of the image... it will be fixed soon,nonetheless,as well
as adding fully customizable computation too. It needs to compute the height map of the image first,and use it to generate the normal
map.
