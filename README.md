# Axomae

Axomae is a texture generation tool, to create normal maps , height maps , and distortion maps.

The software is still in developpement. I plan integrating : 

  -Full GPGPU support : the software can already use CUDA (not tested for GPUs other than compute capability 61), but needs some               work.
  
  -Mesh normals projection into texture : using a high poly mesh to create a normal map texture.
  
  -Bach processing : either processing textures or creating normal maps from numerous meshes.
  
  -An OpenGL renderer : A 3D renderer using PBR materials and reading GLTF , FBX , OBJ formats.
  
  -UV editor .
  
  -real time texture modifications and material modifications.
